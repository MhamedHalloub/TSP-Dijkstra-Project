🚀 TSP Solver with Dijkstra’s Algorithm
📌 Project Overview
This project solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) by leveraging Dijkstra's Algorithm to compute the shortest paths between cities. The goal is to optimize route planning and minimize travel distance.

🛠 Key Features:
✅ Compute the shortest path between two cities using Dijkstra’s Algorithm
✅ Solve the TSP using brute force or dynamic programming
✅ Integrate both approaches to find the optimal tour
✅ Graph representation of cities and paths

🛠 Technologies Used
Python (or C++, Java, etc.)
Graph Algorithms
Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Combinatorial Optimization

🚀 Installation & Usage
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
sh
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/TSP-Dijkstra-Project.git
cd TSP-Dijkstra-Project
2️⃣ Run the Main Script
sh
Copy
